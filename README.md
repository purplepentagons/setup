# setup

Configuration files for my setup. I use Arch Linux and home-manager, and my color scheme is called Distorted Prose.

I'm not as well-acquainted with Nix as some other people are, so reading my code may be difficult.

## Prerequisites
- Arch Linux (for now)
- Hyprland
- Git

Other necessary programs should be installed with home-manager.

## Installation
Enter the scripts directory and run the script that corresponds to your operating system.
